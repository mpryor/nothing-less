# Nothing-less (nless)

Nless is a TUI paging application that has enhanced support for tabular data - such as inferring file delimiters, delimiter swapping on the fly, filtering, sorting, searching, and real-time event parsing

## Demos
### Basic functionality
The below demo shows basic functionality:
- starting with a search `/`
- applying that search `&`
- filtering the selected column by the value within the selected cell `F`
